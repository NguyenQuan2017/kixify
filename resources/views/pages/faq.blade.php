With 153 million people out there using Paypal to buy things online, it has quickly become the global standard. It is unbelievably easy to get a paypal business account.

                     <p>This is where you, as a seller, communicate with your buyers. You can write a "welcome to your store" message, outline shipping, return, exchange, payment and other policies as well as any other information that might be important to the sale.</p>

                     <p>Log into your Paypal account, open the transaction that you want to refund. On the transaction page, there will be a "Refund" button which will refund the payment to the buyer. Once the refund is completed, Kixify will automatically cancel the order and waive any fees associated with the transaction. Refunded orders will be removed from your dashboard and monthly invoice. Simple!</p>

                     <h4>Do I need a business license, Tax ID, or Legal Business Name to upgrade to a PayPal Business account?</h4>
                     <p>You are NOT required to have business license, Tax ID, or Legal Business Name to upgrade to a PayPal Business account. Additionally, PayPal advises if you don't have a Legal Business Name, simply enter something that represents what you're doing. Most of our sellers choose the store name as their business name. This simply protects your personal name from being shared with your buyers. Instead, they will see your business name on their statements and invoices.</p>

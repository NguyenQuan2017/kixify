            <h2>3. Fees and Billing</h2>
            <p>Joining and setting up a shop on Kixify is free. Kixify does not charge fees for listing an item for sale. We simply charge an 8% commission fee only when an item is sold. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Kixify's services are effective after Kixify provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, Kixify may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Kixify's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days); such changes are effective when Kixify posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. Kixify may, at Kixify's sole discretion, change some or all of Kixify's services at any time. In the event Kixify introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD). In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction, Kixify may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller's billing statement. You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Kixify. Kixify will send an invoice to the seller’s email address on file detailing the amount due for the prior month’s commissions. The seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice, or the account will be considered past due. Fees and Termination: If Kixify terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Kixify fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Kixify for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Kixify.</p>
            <h2>4. Listing and Selling</h2>

Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing. Shop Policies: All sellers are urged to outline shop policies for their Kixify shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with Kixify's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Kixify reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy. Binding Sale: All sales are binding.

The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance. Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Kixify transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.</p>
